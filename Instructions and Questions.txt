BACKGROUND

For this case study, think of an imaginary company. The company serves Clients where each Client is handled by Client Team Leader(s), Agent(s), and a Customer Success Manager.
"Clients" are the companies that we provide service for. "Customers" are the people who purchase our Client's product. Agent(s) directly provide service to the Clients. Everytime a Client Team Leader or Agent or anyone is assigned to a client, the event is recorded in the so called Position Time Machine table.

DATA

In the 'Position Time Machine' sheet, there are 10 columns with the following information:

"position_id --> ID of the event
created_at --> the time where the event was created by the system
relationship --> relationship between left to_param and right to_param
left type --> the type of the left entity
left to_param --> unique identifier for the left entity
right type --> the type of the right entity
right to_param --> unique identifier for the right entity
start_at --> the time when the event starts
end_at --> the time when the event ends
duration --> duration of the event"


QUESTIONS
1. Write in order, the top 5 clients that can be called as the biggest starter at the company. Hint: To get this, you'll need to measure and compare the team size of the clients in their first month of service. Assume: First month of service is the month where very first movement happens.
2. What is the typical client lifetime? Please consider and mention specifically the statistical quantity you use to determine this value.
